## About
This is may attempt at a somewhat affordable laser cutter. Although it might not be as cheap as a lot of the open air diode ones, I anteted to make sure that it was safe to use, and that it would still be able to cut wood and thin acrylic. 
## Why make this.
Although it might not be the cheapest diode laser, it is still a lot less expensive than a CO2 laser, and this is enclosed meaning that it will not have to many open fumes. Also I made it witha  10 W laser, so that it would be able to cut most materials as long as it is less than 1 cm thics. I also want to be able to laser cutt parts for other builds, as a lot fo my flat 3d prints warp without an enclosure, so this would be a way fast way to be able to make large, thin, flat things.
