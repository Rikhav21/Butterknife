# Butterknife
This is my attempt at making a laser cutter.
## Day 1 (16/6/25)
Today I mainly just did research into how a laser cutter works, different mechanisms etc. Currently my idea is to just make a core XY, like the gantry of the printer that I designed a few months ago. I think tha tI will eaither go with 10 or 20 watts. And an enclosure is absolutely madatory. I got some plywood, and I am probably going to make the frame out of that.
""Total Time spent: 4 hours**

## Day 2 (17/6/25)
Today I started to work on the CAD of my laser cutter, did some research into potential parts, and desided that I am goign to use 20 Watts for my saser cutter. That takes up almost a forth of the budget, I think that I might be able to find a coupon or something. Also believe it or not I think that I will actually be done with the CAD tomorrow, so lets hope that I can get this approved relatively quick

""Total Time spent: 4 and a half hours**
## Day 3 (17/6/25)
Today I actually spent a lot of time recearching again, and I realized that lasers are actually a lot mor eexpensive than I thought. The "20" Watt laser that I was looking at actually only have 20 watts of input power, and the optical power was closer to 5 Watts. I am going to have to search more, because most of the cheaper lasers taht I was looking at do the same thing, so the laser might end up being one of the more expensive parts on this. On the other hand, I got some wood for the fram, and I finished up most of the CAD for the butterknife itself, but I still have the laser toolhead left, and outer encolosure. TOday it might not look like I did a lot, but a ton of research, parts finding, and just general replanning happened today.
