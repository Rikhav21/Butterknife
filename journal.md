This is my attempt at making a laser cutter.
## Day 1 (16/6/25)
Today I mainly just did research into how a laser cutter works, different mechanisms etc. Currently my idea is to just make a core XY, like the gantry of the printer that I designed a few months ago. I think tha tI will eaither go with 10 or 20 watts. And an enclosure is absolutely madatory. I got some plywood, and I am probably going to make the frame out of that.
""Total Time spent: 4 hours**

## Day 2 (17/6/25)
Today I started to work on the CAD of my laser cutter, did some research into potential parts, and desided that I am goign to use 20 Watts for my saser cutter. That takes up almost a forth of the budget, I think that I might be able to find a coupon or something. Also believe it or not I think that I will actually be done with the CAD tomorrow, so lets hope that I can get this approved relatively quick
